# embeddingProject
Project where I explore different input feature vectors and see how they affect downstream sentiment analysis.

The project is done over 10-12 weeks, typically a few hours / week. I am the only one working on the project, though Chao Wu acts as a mentor I consult with ~30 min/wk. 

Comparing the following:

-bow vectors

-tfidf vectors

-word2vec vectors

-fastText vectors (if time allows)

-glove vectors (if time allows)

-LSTM vectors

-BERT vectors

The Notebooks go in the following order:
1st) A history of Vectorizers
2nd) Initial Data Exploration
3rd) Early Vectorizers
4th) LSTM Embeds
5th) BERT
