# embeddingProject
Project where I explore different input feature vectors and see how they affect downstream sentiment analysis.

The project is done over 10-12 weeks, typically a few hours / week. I am the only one working on the project, though Chao Wu acts as a mentor I consult with ~30 min/wk. 

Comparing the following:
-bow vectors
-count vectors
-tfidf vectors
-word2vec vectors
-fastText vectors 
-glove vectors (if time allows)
-LSTM vectors
-BERT vectors
